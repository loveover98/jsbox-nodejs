# JSBox Node.js

[JSBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1312014438) 2.0 provides support for the Node.js runtime, the corresponding documentation is hosted separately since it's quite different compared to the JSBox runtime.

If you are interested in the JSBox runtime's documentation, you could find it [here](https://docs.xteko.com/#/en/).
